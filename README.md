# Dwarf Fortress Chronicles

Generate stories from Dwarf Fortress legends data.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

The Dwarf Fortress Chronicle Generator is a unique and complex project that stands apart from earlier projects such as our e-commerce and social media web applications.

- **Unique Domain:** Unlike common domains such as e-commerce or social media, this project operates in the niche domain of game world history narration. It required a deep dive into the data of Dwarf Fortress, and its world history files. It posed many questions such as how to interpret this data into engaging narratives.

- **Complex Data Processing:** The project involves complex data processing tasks. It requires converting XML files into JSON, interpreting the data, and generating narratives using AI. This is a more complex task than handling standard data types in other applications.

- **AI Integration:** The use of AI to generate narratives adds a layer of complexity. It requires knowledge of AI, communication with a third-party API, and how to integrate it into a web application.

- **Advanced Search Functionality:** The search and filter functionality goes beyond standard search features in e-commerce or social media apps. It allows users to search for specific stories or historical events, requiring a more complex search algorithm.

- **User Feedback and Ratings:** Implementing a system for user feedback and ratings adds another layer of complexity. It requires creating a system for users to rate and review generated stories, and a way to handle and store this data.

## Build notes

- **Docker:** In the main directory, run the commands 'docker-compose build' and 'docker-compose up' in your terminal.
- **Windows:** If building on a Windows machine, you may need to ensure you have WSL2 installed with a Linux distribution, (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install , https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl#install-nvm-nodejs-and-npm) as well as a Postgres client

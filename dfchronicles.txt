Project Name: Dwarf Fortress Chronicle Generator

Description:
The Dwarf Fortress Chronicle Generator is a web application that takes Dwarf Fortress world history files uploaded by users and uses AI techniques to create narrative stories based on the historical events within those worlds. Users can explore the unique and complex histories of their Dwarf Fortress worlds through generated stories.

Key Features:

    User Authentication and Uploads:
        Implement user authentication and user profiles using Django.
        Users can upload their Dwarf Fortress world history files for analysis and story generation.

    AI Analysis of World History:
        AI component that can parse and analyze the uploaded Dwarf Fortress world history files.
        The AI should identify significant historical events, characters, civilizations, wars, and other notable occurrences.

    Narrative Generation:
        Use the AI analysis to generate narratives that tell stories about the world's history.
        The narratives should be engaging, coherent, and detailed, showcasing the rich content of Dwarf Fortress worlds.
		Each found story makes a 'book' about the event. A hero slaying a monster, a civilization that stood the test of time, etc.

    Interactive Story Presentation:
        Display generated stories in an interactive and visually appealing format on the web platform.
        Allow users to navigate through different parts of the story and explore specific events or characters.

    Story Customization:
        Give users the ability to customize the generated stories by selecting specific events or characters to focus on.
        Provide options to tweak the narrative style or length.

    Database Storage:
        Store user profiles, uploaded world history files, and generated stories in a database for easy retrieval and access.

    Search and Browse:
        Implement a search and filter functionality, allowing users to search for specific stories or historical events from their uploaded world history files.

    User Feedback and Ratings:
        Enable users to provide feedback on generated stories and rate them.
        Use this feedback to improve the AI's narrative generation over time.

Monetization Options:

    Freemium Model: Offer basic narrative generation for free and provide premium features such as advanced story customization or ad-free experience for a subscription fee.

    Ads and Sponsorships: Display relevant ads on the platform, potentially collaborating with Dwarf Fortress-related communities or modders.

    Donations: Allow users to make voluntary donations to support the platform and access special features.

Tech Stack:

    Django for backend and user authentication.
    AI/ML libraries for text analysis and narrative generation.
    React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface.
    Database (Postgres) for storing user data and generated stories.


First Thoughts:

legends.xml+ legends_plus.xml
https://www.dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Legends
Huge amount of data (aprox. $30,000 worth of tokens in raw data). This absolutely needs to be cleaned, or the project will simply be impossible. Available AI/ML models have nowhere near this much context length anyways, so something needs to be done.

After getting the data from xml, we can store in the servers database.

We can try to limit the data sent by sorting the data in relation to our best guesses at good stories. Big civilizations, old monsters, etc. and sending the data only relating to that topic

visualize data and allow sorting. when viewing historical figure, maybe plot events over time, be able to sort by most events/ highest skill/ most hated/ etc

find a way to determine possible interesting stories before sending relevant data to ai (super old necromancer hated by every civilization, adventurer who defeated said necromancer, etc)


WRITEUP THOUGHTS:
show some sample XML data, explain the smallest dataset was over 1.3million lines. Sorted and transferred to database for use later.
Speed of data entry is biggest flaw currently
Beautiful game, complicated data:
    maybe these things go hand in hand
    so much data, specifically in HistoricalEvents, seemed redundant and with many different names (site_hfid, site_id, site | hist_fig_id histfig hfid hist_figure_id)
    
could rewrite historical events into multiple data types based on content to minimize empty fields.
Much of this (data entry) feels like a minimum viable product. there can be several improvements in speed and intricacy with more time and resources invested.


SAMPLE:
    In the annals of history, the Chronicles of the Fantasy Realm, another chapter unfolded, adding more pages to the tapestry of events. This tale, known as "The Searing War," brought conflict and conquest to the world, igniting the passions of both humans and goblins.

As the ninth year dawned, two great civilizations clashed in a blaze of fury. On one side stood the "Confederacy of Directions," a human civilization known for their fierce determination and ambition. Their leader, General Ramul Shovedrasped, led the charge. Alongside him were brave souls like Unib Paintdreamed, a dwarf of unwavering spirit, and Aye Adorebrushed, an elf of ancient wisdom.

The other side of this bitter conflict was "The Cruelty of Punches," a goblin civilization infamous for their relentless brutality. Their leader, General Ngokang Profanevandal, had a fearsome reputation. He was joined by goblin warriors like Snodub Profanetrap, Xuspgas Blackwheel, and Nguslu Basinfiends.

The battleground for this epic struggle was the sinister site of "Frothflies," a dark pit filled with treacherous traps and hidden horrors. The forces clashed in a fierce battle, where lives were sacrificed, and the ground soaked with the blood of the fallen. When the dust settled, it was the humans who emerged victorious, the goblins defeated, and their dark pit conquered.

But the story didn't end there. The "Confederacy of Directions" continued their march, their ambitions unquenched. As the year drew to a close, they set their sights on the "Cruelty of Punches," intent on plundering the goblin civilization. General Oddom Highhandle, a Moon Brute of unparalleled strength, led this daring expedition. With unyielding determination, they descended upon the goblin realm.

As the final pages of the year turned, "Frothflies" witnessed yet another pivotal moment in this saga. The goblin civilization, once feared and relentless, now faced the relentless advance of the humans. In a turn of events, "The Cruelty of Punches" was conquered, its once-mighty forces brought to their knees.

And so, "The Searing War" came to an end, leaving a trail of triumph, sacrifice, and the eternal echoes of conflict in the annals of history. The world of the fantasy realm continued to evolve, with each battle and conquest shaping its destiny, as recorded by the diligent archivists of this enchanting realm.

Project Name: Dwarf Fortress Chronicle Generator

Description:
The Dwarf Fortress Chronicle Generator is a web application that takes Dwarf Fortress world history files uploaded by users and uses AI techniques to create narrative stories based on the historical events within those worlds. Users can explore the unique and complex histories of their Dwarf Fortress worlds through generated stories.

Key Features:

    User Authentication and Uploads:
        Implement user authentication and user profiles using Django.
        Users can upload their Dwarf Fortress world history files for analysis and story generation.

    AI Analysis of World History:
        AI component that can parse and analyze the uploaded Dwarf Fortress world history files.
        The AI should identify significant historical events, characters, civilizations, wars, and other notable occurrences.

    Narrative Generation:
        Use the AI analysis to generate narratives that tell stories about the world's history.
        The narratives should be engaging, coherent, and detailed, showcasing the rich content of Dwarf Fortress worlds.
		Each found story makes a 'book' about the event. A hero slaying a monster, a civilization that stood the test of time, etc.

    Interactive Story Presentation:
        Display generated stories in an interactive and visually appealing format on the web platform.
        Allow users to navigate through different parts of the story and explore specific events or characters.

    Story Customization:
        Give users the ability to customize the generated stories by selecting specific events or characters to focus on.
        Provide options to tweak the narrative style or length.

    Database Storage:
        Store user profiles, uploaded world history files, and generated stories in a database for easy retrieval and access.

    Search and Browse:
        Implement a search and filter functionality, allowing users to search for specific stories or historical events from their uploaded world history files.

    User Feedback and Ratings:
        Enable users to provide feedback on generated stories and rate them.
        Use this feedback to improve the AI's narrative generation over time.

Monetization Options:

    Freemium Model: Offer basic narrative generation for free and provide premium features such as advanced story customization or ad-free experience for a subscription fee.

    Ads and Sponsorships: Display relevant ads on the platform, potentially collaborating with Dwarf Fortress-related communities or modders.

    Donations: Allow users to make voluntary donations to support the platform and access special features.

Tech Stack:

    Django for backend and user authentication.
    AI/ML libraries for text analysis and narrative generation.
    React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface.
    Database (Postgres) for storing user data and generated stories.


First Thoughts:

legends.xml+ legends_plus.xml
https://www.dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Legends
Huge amount of data (aprox. $30,000 worth of tokens in raw data). This absolutely needs to be cleaned, or the project will simply be impossible. Available AI/ML models have nowhere near this much context length anyways, so something needs to be done.

After getting the data from xml, we can store in the servers database.

We can try to limit the data sent by sorting the data in relation to our best guesses at good stories. Big civilizations, old monsters, etc. and sending the data only relating to that topic

visualize data and allow sorting. when viewing historical figure, maybe plot events over time, be able to sort by most events/ highest skill/ most hated/ etc

find a way to determine possible interesting stories before sending relevant data to ai (super old necromancer hated by every civilization, adventurer who defeated said necromancer, etc)


WRITEUP THOUGHTS:
show some sample XML data, explain the smallest dataset was over 1.3million lines. Sorted and transferred to database for use later.
Speed of data entry is biggest flaw currently
Beautiful game, complicated data:
    maybe these things go hand in hand
    so much data, specifically in HistoricalEvents, seemed redundant and with many different names (site_hfid, site_id, site | hist_fig_id histfig hfid hist_figure_id)
    
could rewrite historical events into multiple data types based on content to minimize empty fields.
Much of this (data entry) feels like a minimum viable product. there can be several improvements in speed and intricacy with more time and resources invested.
Switched to parsing XML in browser. Less current integration and more features to add but now file upload is only a few seconds instead of several minutes.


SAMPLE: 
In the verdant heart of the Forest of Irons, a place untouched by the stain of evil and alive with the rustling whispers of ancient trees, the year of 7 unfolded with the thunderous clamor of conflict. The Plane of Enchanting, known to the stout folk as Sil Minbaz, bore witness to a tale of valor, betrayal, and the eternal struggle for supremacy between the races that dwelt within its borders.

As the year began, the air was already heavy with the scent of impending war. The Jaw of Reverence, a civilization of humans known for their unyielding courage, had cast their gaze upon the territories held by the Cerulean Coalition, a conclave of elves whose wisdom was as deep as the roots of their sacred groves. Thus was born the Furious War, a clash that would see blood spilled on both sides in the name of conquest and defense.

The Forest of Irons, a neutral haven between the two powers, became the stage for a momentous battle known as the Clashes of Targeting. Here, Ugrad Furnacebalded, a human general whose very name evoked the heat of the forge and the spark of strategy, led the charge against the elven forces commanded by Rayali Peltzeal, a defender as fierce as the wild beasts she called kin.

Amidst this grand struggle, a tale of personal vendetta unfolded. En Guardmornings, a human warrior with a gaze as sharp as her arrows, sought out Ola Crabfords, an elf whose grace in battle was sung of in the high canopies. Their duel, a fierce confrontation amidst the greater battle, would end with Ola's demise, struck down by En's relentless assault.

The human attackers, bolstered by their loyal hounds, pressed on with the ferocity of a storm, their numbers including the likes of Kanil Squeezewax and Umcos Autumnspecial, warriors whose names would become synonymous with the fury of human ambition. But the elves, mounted upon majestic unicorns and flanked by their kin from the forest retreats and dark pits, held the line with a resolve that seemed to draw strength from the very earth beneath their feet.

The clash was fierce, and the forest echoed with the sounds of steel on steel, the cries of the fallen, and the rallying shouts of the living. The human onslaught was relentless, but the elves, with their centuries of knowledge and an innate bond with the land, turned the tide. The unicorns, with their ethereal grace and deadly horns, became avatars of the forest's will, and the human forces, despite their valor and strength, found themselves outmaneuvered.

In the end, it was the Cerulean Coalition that emerged victorious, their dominion over the Forest of Irons reaffirmed. The humans, their numbers diminished but their spirits unbroken, retreated to their strongholds to nurse their wounds and to mourn their dead, among them the valiant dogs who had fought by their side.

Thus, the year 7 in the Plane of Enchanting closed with the Forest of Irons still standing as a testament to the elven spirit, unyielding and proud. The Furious War would go on, its end not yet written, but the Clashes of Targeting would be forever etched in the annals of history, a reminder of the sacrifices made in the name of land, honor, and the unquenchable thirst for glory.
